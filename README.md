Naming Conventions

Definitions:

A Python module is simply a Python source file, which can expose classes, functions and global variables.

A Python package is simply a directory of Python module(s).

1. Modules
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

2. Classes
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
